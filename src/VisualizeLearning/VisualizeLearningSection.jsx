                Creating a project-based learning environment where your
                students can choose how they visualize their learning can
                promote a personalized and meaningful learning experience. To
                help your students successfully create projects of their own,
                scaffold lessons to provide ideas and support that will
                encourage their own creative ideas. Here are some ways you can

                      Before students can choose a way to display their
                      knowledge, they need to be familiar with their options. To
                      show your students the different ways they can present
                      their learning, you can include different types of digital
                      tools in your lessons and discuss what types of projects
                      they can be most useful for. After you present the tool,
                      have your students reflect on the product to help them
                      internalize the benefits, drawbacks, and potential uses of
                      the tool.{" "}

                      Consider hosting a discussion after the next presentation
                      you give using Google Slides. Ask your students how Slides
                      is a useful tool for sharing knowledge, what features make
                      it more interesting or engaging, and when they think it
                      may be the most effective tool to use. You could also ask
                      them to work with a partner to brainstorm different
                      digital tools that could have been used to present the
                      same information in a different way. This feedback can
                      help students better understand when they should use
                      different tools and help you improve your own selection of
                      tools when teaching.

                      When your students have the opportunity to be creative and
                      choose their own digital tools, they may each need
                      different amounts and types of support to complete their
                      projects. As you observe your students working, you can
                      provide personalized support to individuals by discussing
                      their progress and any questions that they have. You can
                      also consider finding small groups of students who are
                      using the same tool and discussing how each of them is
                      using it so they can learn from one another's application
                      of the tool.

                      If a student has a question about a digital tool that you
                      canâ€™t answer, encourage them to research a solution
                      online. Then follow up with the student so you can learn
                      from them. This can increase student confidence as well as
                      your ability to support other students in the future. In
                      some cases, you can identify students who are familiar
                      with a digital tool to act as a peer mentor. Peer mentors
                      can help their fellow students and will increase their own
                      expertise through teaching others.

                      formative feedback while they work. You can often make
                      this process more efficient by using digital tools. For
                      example, you might use the comment feature to select
                      specific aspects of a project and provide feedback on a
                      studentâ€™s knowledge of the content and their use of the
                      visual tool. You can even include links to resources on

                      If students are presenting their work to the class,

                      to help students reflect on and improve their use of the
                      visual tool. To achieve this, you could have students use
                      the comment feature in Google tools, such as Slides and
                      Drawings, and in Drive, where you can make comments on
                      image files. You could also encourage students to gather
                      peer feedback on their project using Google Jamboard. This{" "}

                Now it's your turn to try out creating a new copy of a document
                and sharing it. Choose a project that you already use in your
                class that you would like to make more personalized for your
                students. Consider what content the students must cover to
                demonstrate their learning. Next, identify a variety of methods
                and tools your students could use to convey their learning.

                  Use all of this information to create a student choice menu.
                  The menu should clearly identify the task they must complete,
                  list general requirements, and provide options that they can
                  choose from to complete the project. You may even offer the
                  option for students to generate their own ideas. Once your
                  student choice menu is complete, share it with your students
                  to give them more freedom to personalize the projects they
                  create.
