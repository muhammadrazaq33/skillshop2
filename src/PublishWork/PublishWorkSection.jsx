              Students spend a lot of time and effort working on projects and
              other assignments, and it is important for them to have
              opportunities to celebrate that work. Your students may want to
              share their work with other students, teachers, parents, or even
              their community. When students share their work with an audience,
              they are more likely to carefully consider how it appears.
              Publishing work online can also provide authentic practice for how
              to communicate ideas with others.

                One of the common themes throughout Google Workspace for
                Education tools is the ability to share. Google Sites is one
                online tool that students can use to customize and share their
                work without requiring viewers to have an account with a
                specific platform. This creates many opportunities for how
                students can present their work and who their work can be shared
                with. The ability to customize their site in Google Sites makes
                it a valuable tool for a wide variety of projects, such as
                creating an online portfolio of artwork, sharing arguments for a
                class debate, presenting an analysis of a book, or displaying
                the results of a science experiment.

                    the rock cycle, they might have a main page describing the
                    cycle and subpages detailing the three main rock types.

              Google Sites offers creative ways to publish and share student
              work. Sharing their work online is a great way to increase student
              interest in an assignment, practice communication skills, and
              celebrate student work. Publishing their own website allows your
              students to take ownership of their learning and use their
              strengths to make a creative tool to share their knowledge with
              others.

                      Google Sites is a flexible option for publishing student
                      work it allows your students to control the appearance of
                      text, images, and other content they include on a page.
                      While adding text to a page, students can quickly change
                      the textâ€™s style to differentiate headers from normal
                      text. This can help them emphasize certain text and give
                      the page a more personalized appearance. They can also add
                      links from specific words or phrases on one page of their
                      website to another page or website.

                      If your students used placeholders while designing the
                      layout of their page, they can replace them with a variety
                      of types of embedded media to provide more context for
                      visitors to their website. They can include pictures that

                      For example, a student whose website is about musical
                      theory might embed a video of a musical performance for
                      the audience to listen to. This can help make a website
                      more meaningful and provide interactive ways for the
                      audience to engage with the content.

              Now itâ€™s time to consider how to give students a platform to

              learning by creating a website in Google Sites. Choose one
              assignment and create a document with instructions for what they
